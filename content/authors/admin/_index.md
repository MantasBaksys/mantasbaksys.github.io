I am a PhD student at the Computer Lab, University of Cambridge supervised by Prof. Sean Holden. My research interests lie in the broad areas of Automated Theorem Proving and Formal Mathematics. In particular, I am interested in application of Machine Learning for proof-discovery in the setting of interactive theorem provers. I have experience working with reinforcement learning techniques for formal reasoning, having contributed to state-of-the-art models for autoformalization and proving in Lean. Feel free to reach out if you find my research interesting!
