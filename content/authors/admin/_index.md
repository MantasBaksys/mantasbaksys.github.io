I am a PhD student at the Computer Lab, University of Cambridge supervised by Prof. Sean Holden. My research interests lie the broad areas of Automated Theorem Proving and Formal Mathematics. In particular, I am interesting in application of Machine Learning for proof-discovery in the setting of interactive theorem provers. Feel free to reach out if you find my research interesting!
