Hi! I am currently Part III Mathematics student at the University of Cambridge. My research interests lie the broad area of formal mathematics, in which I have already completed sever research internships during my time as an undergraduate. In particular, I am interested in automated proof-discovery using both ML and classical approaches and formalisation of mathematics. Feel free to reach out if you find these topics interesting and would like to chat! \\
